## Bugs
### Solved bugs
- The Products page was not responsive. This was due to a missing width style. This was solved by checking over the CSS code and ensuring all width styles were width:100%;
- Using CodeAnywhere to begin with had added a number of forward slashes to closing brackets where they were not required, as can be seen in the image below. This was solved simply by the removal of the tags.
