## Design

### Colour Scheme.

![Colours](documentation/colours.png)
The colour scheme of the webpage is listed below. This was chosen as it complements images of plants as well as being appealing to the user’s view.
The main colour, Dark green, was used as it represents images of plants. Dark greens also contain a soothing psychological effect on the user, so if they access the webpage anxious about the health of their plant they shall be soothed by the colour of the webpage.
The font is white as this provides contrast to the dark green background and enables the user to easily view the text on the site.
The pale green used on the form provides contrast to the dark green background and creates emphasis on the form submission button.

### Typography
![Mooli](documentation/mooli.png)
Mooli was used to create the company logo in size 400 as the elegance and sophistication of the font convey a sense of refinement and luxury. As well as this the softness of the font provides a feeling of relaxation to the user.

![Raleway](documentation/raleway.png)
The main webpage font is Raleway as this is easy to read and for the user to follow along with the text. The font size for each section remained the same at 30 as this provides the user with consistency throughout the webpage.

## Wireframes
[Wireframes](documentation/wireframes.pdf)

The wireframes for my project were generated using Baslsamiq. They all correspond with the web pages I have created, however, the wireframe for the products page is slightly different. This is because once reviewing the layout, I felt that the page flowed better in a column allowing the user to scroll through products.

## Testing

Please see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for all files relating to the testing of the final webpage.

## Deployment

## Future plans

Future plans for the development of this webpage include:
- Generating an error 404 page that corresponds with the theme of the site.
- Produce more congruent commit messages throughout the project.
- Create social media pages that can be added to the footer links.
- Add a lighthouse and WAVE report to the validation.

## Credits
